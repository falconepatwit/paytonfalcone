      This project involved creating a bot that would automate actions on a user's 
      account, such as liking, following, direct messaging, commenting, and unfollowing 
      based on user input. This input was given by creating a basic GUI using PyQT5, 
      taking in user input, then storing the data they inserted. The bot would 
      then use Selenium to interact with the various parts of the Instagram website to 
      complete the tasks the user inserted. For example, if a user wanted to follow 
      three different accounts on Instagram, the bot would use Selenium to travel to 
      those three accounts and then follow them. Alternatively, a user may input that they want to unfollow 
      a certain amount of people, and the bot will unfollow that amount of people from the top of their following list.
