      This group project was created to help us understand data structures and sorting better by developing a boss rush style game 
      and displaying these components in a visual format. The game consisted of four different levels: 
      queues, stacks, binary trees, and the sorting algorithm Merge Sort. These levels were accessed through our
       menu GUI that would allow the user to select each stage through unique key presses. The stack level shows off stacks through the "Burger Boss", who throws condiment attacks at the player that are 
      organized and refreshed in a stack format. The queue boss has different attacks that it queues up, then unleashes those attacks 
      in a queue like order at the player. The binary tree level gave the player a prompt of binary tree traversal 
      methods, and the player had to go to the correct portion of the map that is represented by that particular prompt, 
      otherwise the tree boss would attack the player. Finally, the Merge Sort level consisted of a boss that 
      had multiple spheres which were random at first, sorted using Merge Sort, then used to attack the player. 
      This project was created through the use of numerous organized classes and helper methods in Java, 
      allowing for easier distribution of work. In addition, we used GitHub for source control, and to allow us to each work in our own branch, 
      at our own pace.
