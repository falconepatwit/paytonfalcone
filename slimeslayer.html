      This game currently has 5 different zones, each with a different enemy type: 
      Grassy Plains, Fluorescent Fields, Cerulean Clearing, The Final Forest, and King Slime's 
      Castle. The game contains one class currently (the knight), although I am 
      currently working on the mage and archer classes. The game has a boss for the 
      level, the king slime, which has two different attack types that challenge the 
      player to use the mechanics in creative ways to defeat him. There is a questing 
      system, in which each area contains its own unique quest, and a shop in each area to 
      spend the gold received by completing these quests or defeating enemies. The project 
      has a Spawn Manager which, after a cooldown, will spawn the correct enemies in a 
      random area inside of their specific zone (up until the spawn cap for that area). 
      There is a saving and loading system, which creates files on the player's computer
       storing the variables that are required in the playthrough, such as location, 
       current health, attack, maximum health, and many more. This data is converted to 
       binary using a Binary Formatter, to ensure that the player is unable to change 
       their save data to get an advantage. The save method specifically creates a file 
       stream which will in turn create and serialize the save data inside of the 
       player's computer, a directory that is decided by the "persistentDataPath" 
       command. When running the load function, it checks if there is a file inside of 
       that specific path, and if so it will open that data using a new file stream, 
       deserializing and returning the data found. This game also included an array of sound effects, 
       consisting of two different background music tracks, two player attacking sound effects, 
       enemy idle and hurt sound effects, block sound effects, and much more. These sounds 
       were able to be adjusted using the options menu, which incorporated a volume slider 
       so that the player could easily adjust the sound without leaving the game.
