      This project was developed to become more familiar with JavaFX by recreating the classic game Minesweeper. 
      This game included three different difficulty settings, allowing for repeated attempts if a player wanted a more challenging experience, while staying accessible to those who prefer an easier difficulty. 
      The game contained random mine placement, with a system to detect nearby mines and display 
      that number on the opened squares. The project had a win-and-loss screen and included the minesweeper mechanic 
      of never hitting a mine on the player's first turn. Also incorporated a mine counter, a reset button by clicking on the image of the yellow 
      face, and a timer so that the player can challenge themselves to complete the game quicker.
